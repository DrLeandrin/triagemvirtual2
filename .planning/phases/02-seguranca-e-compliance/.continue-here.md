<current_state>
Phase 2 planning was started with /gsd:plan-phase 2. The research step completed successfully — 02-RESEARCH.md was written. The workflow was paused BEFORE the planner agent was spawned (step 8 of the plan-phase workflow). No PLAN.md files exist yet.
</current_state>

<completed_work>

- Environment validated (.planning/ exists)
- Model profiles resolved (researcher=sonnet, planner=opus, checker=sonnet)
- Phase 2 directory created: .planning/phases/02-seguranca-e-compliance/
- Phase validated against ROADMAP.md (Fase 2: Seguranca e Compliance)
- No CONTEXT.md found (no prior /gsd:discuss-phase decisions)
- Research agent spawned and completed successfully
- 02-RESEARCH.md written with HIGH confidence findings
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

- Step 7: Read context files (STATE, ROADMAP, REQUIREMENTS, RESEARCH) for planner
- Step 8: Spawn gsd-planner agent to create PLAN.md files
- Step 9: Handle planner return
- Step 10: Spawn gsd-plan-checker to verify plans
- Step 11: Handle checker return
- Step 12: Revision loop if needed (max 3 iterations)
- Step 13: Present final status with Next Up block
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- Research was not skipped (no --skip-research flag, config workflow.research=true)
- No CONTEXT.md exists — all implementation choices are at Claude's discretion
- Phase slug: seguranca-e-compliance
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- None. Research completed cleanly with HIGH confidence.
- Note from research: LGPD consent legal text requires Brazilian legal counsel review (LOW confidence on exact wording — use placeholder during development).
</blockers>

<context>
We are mid-way through the /gsd:plan-phase 2 workflow. Research is done and covers:
1. LGPD consent requirements (explicit, purpose-specific consent for health data)
2. RLS optimization (wrap auth.uid() in SELECT, add btree indexes)
3. Consent modal must gate triage access via middleware
4. consent_records table with soft-delete withdrawal support
5. No new dependencies needed — existing stack sufficient

The next step is to resume the plan-phase workflow from step 7 (read context files) and spawn the planner agent.
</context>

<next_action>
Resume with: /gsd:plan-phase 2 --skip-research
This will skip research (already done in 02-RESEARCH.md) and proceed directly to planning.
